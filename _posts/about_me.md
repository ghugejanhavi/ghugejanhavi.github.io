Since my school days, I have loved to plot and read graphs from books and newspapers. Fast forward to my college days came to know about the field of data science and after exploring it, developed an interest in it. 
I have knowledge of Python, MySQL, Power BI, and Statistics and currently studying Machine Learning from the 1-year program of Full Stack Data Science course under iNeuron.ai
I am proficient with verbal and written communication and have strong analytical, problem-solving, and presentation skills along with technical skills. 
I would like to be in a data-driven and challenging organization as a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, or Junior Data scientist leveraging analytical skills to generate insights and solve business problems.
